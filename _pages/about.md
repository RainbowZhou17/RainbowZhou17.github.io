------
I am currently pursuing an MEng degree at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) and working at [Power Electronics and Advanced Control Center](https://www.auto.uestc.edu.cn/info/1032/2106.htm) under the supervision of Prof. Yong Chen. My MEng degree will be received in early July 2025.

My BEng degree has been obtained at [SWJTU-LEEDS School](https://leeds.swjtu.edu.cn/) in [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) with a first-class degree in 2022.

Research Interests
------
I am interested in researching different control theories and various dynamic systems, including multiagents, robotics, and intelligent control. I am also interested in developing methods to optimize the control performance. Currently, I am mainly focusing on theoretical research. I am looking forward to extending my research to more practical fields in future studies.

  - Distributed System
  - Consensus Control
  - Multiagent System
  - Intelligent Control
