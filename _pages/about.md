I am currently pursuing an MEng degree at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) and working at [Power Electronics and Advanced Control Center](https://www.auto.uestc.edu.cn/info/1032/2106.htm) under the supervision of Prof. Yong Chen. I received a BEng degree at [SWJTU-LEEDS School](https://leeds.swjtu.edu.cn/) in [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) with a first-class degree in 2022.
The specific information including my CV, academic transcripts and graduation certificate is given below:

Research Interests
------
  - Distributed System
  - Cooperative Control
  - Multiagent System
  - Control Theory
I am interested in researching different control theories to achieve the control of dynamic systems (linear and nonlinear), including multiagents and robotics. I am also interested in exploring methods to optimize control performance. My current focus is primarily on theoretical research. In the future, I want to bring the theoretical work to practical applications.
