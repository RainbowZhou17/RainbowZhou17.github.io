About Me
------
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electronic Information at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) and working at [Power Electronics and Advanced Control Center](https://www.auto.uestc.edu.cn/info/1032/2106.htm) under the supervision of Prof. [Yong Chen](https://www.auto.uestc.edu.cn/info/1152/4311.htm). My MEng degree will be received in early July 2025.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [SWJTU Joint School with the University of Leeds](https://leeds.swjtu.edu.cn/) in [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) with a first-class degree in 2022.
